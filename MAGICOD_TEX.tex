\medskip
The flier flies around a cloud in top speed, gathering electricity for one turn and upon second turn, dives towards enemy as if Sprinting. When the character comes to a halt, she releases an Area of Effect - lightning attack on a Small Burst template. Thaumaturgy is rolled on the second turn.

The second turn follows the same rules as regular Sprinting. The first turn doesn't spend AP, but the next turn's performing of the aerial sprint consumes all of the flier's AP for that turn. This Electric AoE attack deals Potency*2+10+(3) damage to non-robots, Robots take three times the damage and Power Armor takes twice the damage.

If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, the the flier ends up prone on the ground, but with electricity still gathered onto them, giving a shock to any melee or unarmed attackers that hit her for that Round. This electric attack deals AGI+5+(3) damage. After the execution Round, the electricity disperses.

The flyer can manipulate clouds to different effects, such as causing momentary weather effects or striking all enemies with lightning-bolts. Thaumaturgy roll is used to determine success. Area of effect is determined by the flier's Potency as shown below:

\medskip

Flier flies fast enough to create a contrail behind them, and flies low enough to distract their enemy, giving all enemies they fly past a Distraction, its severity determined by the flier's Potency. Flier must fly in a straight line. The enemies will suffer from a visibility penalty of -10 for 2 turns.

	\end{tabu}
		
}

\medskip

The flier speeds up, flying towards the enemy and bombarding them with gunfire or magical energy, targeting enemies in a line at the maximum of Potency*2 meters (Potency hexes).

The Maneuver requires a successful Firearms/MEW roll in addition to Thaumaturgy roll. The weapon must be Full-Auto weapon.
If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, the flier ends up on the ground, knocked prone, but doesn't lose AP from trying to perform the maneuver. However, they will lose Strain. If the Firearms/MEW roll fails, the flier has performed the maneuver, but misses the targets.

	\end{tabu}
		
}

\medskip

The flier flies low to the ground, in a circle with a maximum size determined by her Potency, protecting all allies inside the circle with the air pressure from their flight. Allies inside the circle have extra 10 DT until caster's next turn. The affected area is determined by flier's Potency.

To perform this maneuver, the flier must successfully roll Thaumaturgy -20 or be flown off course for 10 meters (5 hexes) and get knocked prone in a random direction.

GM decides the direction a failed maneuverer flies towards with a roll of the dice, 1d6 for each main direction. If they crash against someone, they take damage according to the falling template.

  \end{description}
\end{quote}

The flier can maintain this Spiral for a single turn, and must rest their wings for the next turn - they cannot perform maneuvers but can still otherwise act.

\medskip

Flier makes a dainty twirl near the ground, dispelling fog, poisonous clouds or put out small fires in an area determined by her Potency. Additionally, the flier may instead spread these effects to an equally sized area, in case of fire or smoke. This maneuver also removes Burning-status from all targets within the affected area. Thaumaturgy roll is required.

\medskip

The Flier grabs onto a target and drags the target along the ground, injuring them. This attack follows the rules of Sprinting.

Requires a successful opposed roll of flier's Thaumaturgy against the target's STR. If the target is successful, the flier ends up on the ground, in a grapple with the target. Deals Potency*2+10+(2) damage to the target if flier is successful.

\medskip

The flier makes a straight dashing line towards the target, and takes a sharp turn upwards leaving behind a flash of bright light on a Tiny Burst area.

Thaumaturgy roll is required to successfully perform, after which an opposed roll follows; target(s) will make Opposed PER roll against flier's CHA or be Blinded for 2 turns.

If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, the character remains in air, but the effects of the maneuver do not happen. AP is depleted, but Strain is not.

\medskip

The flier charges towards an enemy, staying close to the ground and leaving behind a trail of fire that burns all that come into contact with it. Anyone caught in it may gain Burning status. The trail of fire lasts for Potency/2 turns. This attack is a Charge, meaning they get bonuses and penalties accordingly.

A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required to perform this Maneuver.

\medskip

The flier grabs their target and carries them high to the sky, then throws the target plummeting towards ground. Requires a successful opposed roll of the Flier's Thaumaturgy -10 to the target's STR.

The target takes Potency*3+(4) damage, and ends up Prone on the ground. Targets beyond one (1) Size Increment larger than the flier are impossible to lift.

If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, the flier ends up on the ground in a Grapple with the target as an attacker. Both take damage according to Falling damage table due to collision.

\medskip

Flier soars high in the air, then dives down to deliver a shock wave that explodes in a multi-colored mushroom cloud when a successful Thaumaturgy roll is made.
Initial blast deals Potency*3+(5) damage. Everyone caught in the attack may attempt to stay upright from the blast with a successful STR -1 roll, or be knocked prone from the attack.

If the flier is a ghoul, they inflict an additional 1 Rad at 3x40\% alongside the damage, however, this will deplete their accumulated rads by half to a minimum of 1.

\medskip

Sun Celebration is a bit more difficult of a maneuver to pull off in the often-cloudy Wasteland: As her first action, the flier must disperse clouds from a Small Burst area with a Thaumaturgy check. Dispersing the clouds costs 5 AP, and the dispersed clouds gather after 5 turns.

As her second action, she positions herself in front of the sun to deal a Distraction to all who look upon her, and fail a PER roll. The positioning costs 6 AP, and this Distraction lasts for 2 Turns.

Flier can further worsen or improve the weather conditions, making visibility in a in an area one step further from current visibility condition. For example, a light drizzle of rain (-5 Visibility penalty) would become a downpour (-10 Visibility Penalty) if worsened, or clear skies (no penalty) if improved. The maximum area that is affected by this spell is determined by the caster's potency. Thaumaturgy roll is required.

The flier makes a circular flight around the target, striking them with Melee or Unarmed attacks. Flier returns to the same location where she set off at the beginning of the maneuver.

Costs the combined AP cost of all attacks. However, Flier has -5 AP less to use during her next turn. Flier may use Special Attacks granted by her weapons.

This Maneuver does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Failed Thaumaturgy roll will end the maneuver after first strike on an adjacent hex around the target, and will not cause her to have -5 AP less on her next turn.

\medskip

The flier takes to the sky, scouting the area for hostile targets' precise positions and relaying the info back to their team with a intricate flight pattern. A Thaumaturgy -10 roll is required to execute this maneuver.

The intricate flight pattern is automatically known by other player characters, but ally NPC's have to decipher the meaning with a successful PER-1 roll.
This Aerial Maneuver gives +5 to combat skills and +5 DT to the allies, but doesn't benefit the flier. If the Thaumaturgy roll fails, the flier becomes a target for the opponents, with the enemy getting a +10 in combat skills to attack the flier.

\medskip

The flier performs a shift in air pressure causing a considerable dizziness to targets in a Small Burst template.
Target must make an opposed END-2 roll against fliers END. Afflicted targets have all their actions cost 2 AP more and suffer from Medium Distraction, for 3 turns.

If Flier is a ghoul, Radiation is also emitted, with 2 Rads at 2x60\%. This also depletes their radiation reserves completely.

\medskip

The Flier makes a series of stunning and complicated flying routines, either inspiring their allies or intimidating their opponents in a Large Burst template for 3 turns. Thaumaturgy -20 roll is required for successful maneuvering.

Before executing the maneuver, the flier must decide if they want to boost their allies or demoralize their enemies. On a success, the effects he has chosen happen.

\begin{itemize}
  \item	If the Flier boosts their allies, they gain +10 to all Skill and SPECIAL rolls.
  \item If the Flier demoralizes their enemies, the enemies get a -10 to all skills and SPECIAL rolls.
  \item If the Thaumaturgy roll unsuccessful, all, including the Flier, in the Large Burst Area get a Minor Distraction.

The flier steels her nerves and makes a daringly quick spiral, ignoring any crippled limb she has to carry the fight to the end. Requires a successful Thaumaturgy -30 check to execute.

On a success, the flier ignores one Crippled limb penalty of her choosing for an Potency/2 number of rounds. On a failure, the flier loses 2 HP from stressing her bruised body.

\medskip

The flier attacks their target once during the low-flight part of the first loop, picks up speed to perform the second loop where they descend onto the same target to trample them.

The maneuver requires a Thaumaturgy -20 roll to succeed. On a success, the flier may attack one opponent twice with a Melee or Unarmed weapon, both attacks costing -1 AP (minimum of 1 AP). The opponent may gain Stunned status after the second attack, if successful. On a failure, she may only attack once with normal AP cost, and ends her maneuver adjacent to her target.

The Flier dashes towards a target, flying around then and striking them like a murder of crows or pride of lions, with the use of her beak and talons.

The flier can attack multiple targets within an area determined by her Potency. She strikes with Unarmed attacks as many times as her AP pool allows, with all attacks costing 1 AP less (minimum 1) and dealing additional +(1) damage. She may choose to attack one target or multiple, and after she is unable to attack she ends up adjacent to the last target of her maneuver. The remaining AP cannot be spent on any actions.

At the end of her turn, the flier can choose to continue the maneuver on her next turn. She must make an AGI/END/CHA roll to successfully keep the maneuver going, with a cumulative penalty of 1 after each successive round. If the roll is unsuccessful, she will fall to the ground and is knocked prone.

\medskip

The Flier takes a hovering position in the air, sending gusts of powerful winds in a Large Burst template, causing Medium Distraction. Those within the area of the maneuver can make an opposed END roll against flier's AGI/END/CHA to only suffer a Minor Distraction. Anyone going in or through the area of effect must also do the opposed roll. If Flier has the perk \textit{Roar}, she can combine effects of both to cause the distraction last an additional turn, and on a critical roll, cause a Major Distraction instead. 

The maneuver costs all of the flier's AP. Maneuver ends at her next turn, leaving her on the ground with 5 AP less, and inability to use her wings till the next turn.

The flier picks up speed from her current position, flying straight up fast enough to break the sound barrier and release a multi-colored sonic boom. This sonic boom causes clouds to disperse and deals damage to all in a Huge Burst template. Requires a successful Thaumaturgy -20 check to execute.

The attack deals Potency*4+(5) damage. If the flier is a ghoul, they instead perform the Sonic Radboom, which, in addition to damage and cloud dispersing deals 2 Rads at 5x60\%. This will deplete the flier's Radiation Tracker completely.

This attack requires either the sun or a large source of heat, such as an advancing forest fire. The flier flies close enough to the fiery object to be set on fire, after which the flier will speed up and ram their opponent and spreading the fire at any adjacent characters in a Small Burst Area. Thaumaturgy -10 roll is required for successful maneuvering.

When successfully performing this maneuver, the initial opponent takes Potency*2+(5) damage and may be inflicted with Burning status, with -1 END to resist. Any characters sans performer may also get Burning status but do not otherwise take damage. After the Maneuver, the performer is on the ground. If the performer fails their Thaumaturgy roll, they get the Burning-status instead and take damage accordingly.

The flier carries a single target, an ally or an enemy, to a more favorable position in the battlefield. The flier chooses one target within Huge Burst Template, making a Thaumaturgy -20 check.

On a success, the flier flies to the target, picks it up and moves it up to her Potency*2 meters (Potency hexes) from the target's original position, ending up adjacent to the target after the maneuver. On a failure, the flier ends up knocked prone next to her target, having not moved it at all. Targets beyond one (1) Size Increment larger than the flier are impossible to lift.

\medskip

The sensible Earth Pony uses their innate magic fueled into their voice to help a single ally to calm down from a Panic-Pain Threshold during combat situations. The character doesn't suffer from a Pain Threshold until they take further damage.

Outside of combat, this spell can be used to lower one's Insanity by 1 point, to a minimum of 0. If the target has acquired half or more of their maximum Insanity points, the caster suffers a -10 to their Thaumaturgy roll.

When used to overcome Insanity, this spell cannot be used again in 24 hours to lower Insanity, but can be used to calm down a target from Panic. A critically successful Thaumaturgy-roll causes the Insanity to lower by 2.

If the Insanity-lowering effect is used on an opponent, a CHA Opposed roll is required. If successful, the opponent temporarily becomes more lucid, but not necessarily docile.

\begin{verse}
	\textbf{Example:} Shining Example attempts to use Comforting Words to lower Maabara's Insanity, after she suffered a devastating blow to her psyche courtesy of in-game events. Maabara's maximum insanity is 6, and she currently has 4 points. Because Maabara has more than half of her maximum Insanity points, Shining Example's Thaumaturgy suffers a penalty of -10 to successfully perform this spell.

The Earth Pony receives small magical cues from the earth itself, giving her cryptic warnings of possible danger such as tail twitching or shaky hoof. A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

In combat, this spell gives an extra penalty of 5 to first dodge action.

Outside of combat, this spell gives a +1 to AGI to dodge falling objects or creatures about to crash you, as well as +1 to PER to detect ambushes and traps.

\textbf{Example:} Shining Example uses Earthly Warning to dodge an enemy's action, using 2 AP to dodge, normally giving the enemy -10 to attack. With Earthly Warning, Shining Example gets an additional 5 added to this penalty, making the enemy's attack penalty -15 instead.

The caster can enhance the qualities of up to [CHA] number of plants, such as giving a thorny plant longer thorns and making the plant more damaging, a poisonous plant enhanced with a more potent toxin or a fresh fruit tree to become more nutritious.
A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

The spell requires that the plant in question has been planted in soil, either in the ground or in a flower pot for the spell to work.

The mechanical effects of this spell should be discussed with the GM as it is case-by-case basis on what plants are in the area. It is to be noted that this spell cannot be used to make plants Rad-free.

Most of these magical effects are difficult to spot, but a successful -10 Thaumaturgy or -2 INT roll will reveal the enhanced nature of the plant.
Once the spell is cast, the effect will remain on the plant indefinitely unless a Failsafe-spell is cast or the original caster decides to cancel the effect.

Character can only have up to [CHA] number of enchanted plants, and if she wishes to enhance a new plant, a previously enhanced plant loses its enhancement, chosen by the caster. Canceling the spell doesn't cost AP.

The caster kicks the ground to release a small tremor in the earth, to raise up a platform to create a cover made from stone.

This spell can be used to create pathways where there are none or to otherwise manipulate terrain outside of combat.
It can also be created to make small shelters, though the result is far from comfortable lodging. Said shelter is just barely big enough to house the player party, and sleeping in it doesn't incur Sleep Deprivation. A critical success when creating the shelter gives the characters the Well-Rested status if they rest in it, due to the shelter being more secure and better crafted.

A successful Thaumaturgy roll is required for casting this spell.

A magical-enhanced critter assists the caster in mundane tasks.

At one point of caster's history, she has bonded with a critter with a magical connection. The critter is a loyal companion that will never leave the caster's side, although in combat it usually hides in the caster's inventory or otherwise vanishes from the spot. It can be summoned with this spell from everywhere, and will appear through a portal to where the caster is. The critter can help their master with a myriad of tasks, including but not limited to eavesdropping, fitting into tight spaces and courier tasks.

The critter will obey its master to the best of its abilities. The critter and its master can communicate with each other, even if they wouldn't share a common language. If the master and the critter don't share interests, and if the master treats her assistant badly, there is a chance that the critter might leave its master.

If this spell is acquired at some point during a campaign, it is up to the GM where, when and how a critter assistant emerges. The type of critter that is eligible to become an assistant depends on the campaign, but generally they are small and not exotic, such as birds, rodents, dogs, cats or lizards. The size category of the critter is either -1 or -2, depending on its species.

Exaggerates sensory stimuli, such as sight, sound, smell or taste.

The spell increases the source of a sensory stimulus of targets. At the casting of the spell, the caster must choose one sense (sight, sound, taste, smell or touch). The targets then produce an increased effect of that sense. The spell affects up to 4 targets and they may make an END opposed roll to resist the spell.

The spell can also have a secondary effect. For example, if the caster chooses to boost her own sound, she might gain a bonus to her Intimidation check equal to her Potency.

Caster conjures a ball of anesthetic magical energy. When the energy ball hits a target, it falls immediately into a deep slumber.

The caster must make a Medicine check. If successful, the magical energy will touch the patient correctly, and she loses her sense of touch and pain. This also results in a loss of associated motor capabilities, effectively paralyzing the patient. Duration is Potency hours on a willing or unconscious subject. During the spell's effect, the patient can be healed more efficiently, as she won't panic or tremble. Medicine checks against an anesthetized target gain a bonus of 20 and heal double the normal amount.

The spell can also be used offensively. In such cases, the target makes an END opposed roll against the caster (INT) to resist the spell. The spell causes Stun status effect on an unwilling target, and the target suffers a -15 to all skill checks for Potency rounds. Conventional protective items such as armor won't save the target from the spell. During the spell's effect the target is considered helpless.

\textbf{Note:} Creatures immune to sleep and mind-affecting effects are immune to this spell.

A bolt of pure arcane energy damages the target.
 
Arcane Blast is a basic offensive spell. The caster fires one or more bolts of magical energy. The bolts from an Arcane Blast may be used to target multiple opponents.

The simplest version of Arcane Blast is a bolt of energy that deals damage to a single target. The AP cost for the spell is 3 and the Strain cost is 1. The attack deals magical energy damage equal to Potency+(2). The caster must make a ranged attack roll with her INT in order to hit the target.

Arcane Blast can be made out of a substance of the caster's choosing:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fire - Can inflict with Burning Status
\item Ice - Can inflict with Freezing
\item Arcane - Instead of Status Effects, deals extra (2) damage.
\item Electricity - Can inflict with Stun, and stun robots and Power Armor
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} If countered with \textit{Shield-spell}, the bolt will ricochet at full power in random direction. Similar effect occurs when the spell is targeted against a polished or reflective surface.

\medskip

The caster engraves a mark of arcane energy onto a target or surface, which she can use later to assist other spells.
 
This spell can be used to either leave a magical mark on a selected surface or activate an existing one. Magical marks can be of any design, can be either visible or invisible to the naked eye, and last up to Potency days (the original caster will always be able to see the mark). The casting of the Arcane Mark spell upon the surface where the mark is hidden will also reveal other hidden marks. The spell is rangeless after the initial casting.

The mark can also be programmed to trigger other spell effects once a predefined triggering action or set of words takes place. One must first cast Arcane Mark as well as define the trigger condition, and after that she casts the spell that will be triggered. The triggering spell is active for the duration of the Arcane Mark. The triggering effect is single use and lasts for the duration of the spell or until triggered.

The caster can have up to 4 Arcane Marks at a time.
 
\textbf{Note:} While Cutie Marks are a form of unique arcane mark, no magic may create an artificial Cutie Mark nor cause one to appear before its time.

\textbf{Note:} If an Arcane Mark is placed on the ground or floor (or, if GM approves, onto some other similar large solid platform), it can be used as a target for long-distance teleport.

Caster conjures ominous blood weapons out of the corpses of the fallen or herself.

This spell requires either a fresh corpse (dead for less than 2 hours) or health (HP) to function. Only corpses of creatures that depend on blood can be used. Upon casting this spell, the caster must decide what kind of weapons she conjures (machete, throwing axe, etc.). Only melee or thrown weapons can be conjured.

Spell conjures a number of determined weapons up to a maximum of 4. One corpse of a size 0 pony can produce up to 2 weapons, and in order to conjure more than that, more corpses are required. If no suitable corpses lay around, the caster may use her own life force to conjure weapons. For each weapon she conjures this way she loses 1 HP. The caster cannot kill herself upon casting this spell as once the caster's HP drops to a Pain Threshold, no weapons can be conjured.

Conjured weapons float in the air near the caster by default. The caster must command them to attack or move away from her. Commanding these weapons is equal to the AP cost of the weapon in question. If not commanded, the weapon floats idly and does nothing. The weapons deal damage equal to their normal counterparts, but are destroyed if they are dropped by the caster after a Called Shot against said weapons.

This spell has 50\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster.

Enchants a weapon to ignore designated targets.

Upon casting Bypass on a weapon, the caster determines the spell's precise functionality. In other words, caster tells the weapon which targets to ignore. For example, the caster may enchant a weapon to ignore an ally. Only one specific type can be selected. There are several types of ignorable targets: ponies by race, age or size, characters by alignment (ally, friendly, hostile), objects by type, material or size, walls of type or material, and so on. The GM determines if the enchantment is valid.

The effect can be removed prematurely by destroying the weapon or with Failsafe-spell. Only one Bypass can be active on a weapon at a time.

Summon a predefined object to you.

In order for this spell to function, the to-be-summoned object must be predefined. This is done by touching the object with the caster's horn, and costs no AP or Strain. After that the object can be summoned to the caster from anywhere within the range of the spell, unless it is prevented by magical means.

The cost of the spell varies depending on the size of the object to be summoned. If the object is up to Potency centimeters in its largest dimension, the spell costs 4 AP and 1 Strain. If the object is up to Potency*10 centimeters in its largest dimension, the spell costs 6 AP and 3 Strain. If the object is up to Potency meters in its largest dimension, the spell costs 10 AP and 6 Strain.

The spell lasts on the object until summoned by the caster, after which the spell must be renewed for the item to be summoned again.

An inanimate object is granted life.

Caster touches an inanimate object with her horn; the inanimate object will gain life for the duration of the spell. Upon casting, the caster must make a successful INT roll if she wishes to command the animated object. If the roll fails, the object has a mind of its own and won't directly obey anyone's orders.

The size of the object determines the cost and difficulty of the spell. Size category -2 or smaller items cost 6 AP and 1 Strain, and incur no penalty. Every size category greater than those add 2 AP and 1 Strain to the cost, and cumulative -10 penalty to the INT roll.

\medskip

The complexity of the object also affects the cost of the spell. Simple objects, that would be capable of performing one or two simple activities, such as chairs or books, add no additional cost to the spell. More complex objects that are capable of more simple functions or functions that would aid the caster in combat, such as carts or melee weapons, add 1 additional Strain to the cost of the spell. Very complex items, such as firearms or model robots, add 2 additional Strain to the cost of the spell.

NOTE: There is no upper limit on how many objects a caster can animate, but she is only able to control 4 objects directly and accurately.

NOTE: Attended objects (such as enemy's weapon) can be animated, but the caster must make an opposed roll against object owner's AGI. If the spell is successful, but the caster fails her INT roll, the original owner of the item may make a INT roll to gain control over the item.

Magically make suggestions and alter the behavior of a creature.

Spell allows the caster to influence another creature, giving it commands that will alter its behavior. Controlling other beings is difficult, and as such the caster must state her intentions (verbally or with body language) with as few words as possible, preferably short and to-the-point sentences or movements.

Upon casting the spell, the target may make a CHA or INT (whichever is better) opposed roll to resist the spell. If the target fails, she enters a state of inactivity, staring forward blankly unless a command is given. If the command is simple or non-hazardous, the command is carried out without a problem (for example, opening a door). If the command is complex or dangerous to the target, she may roll to resist the spell again twice, and take the better result. In addition, if the target becomes threatened or shocked, it gains a new opposed roll to shake off the effects of the spell.

The target will perform the desired command to the letter (for example, if ordered to open door, the target will open the door once). The maximum duration of the spell is Potency minutes, during which the caster may issue new commands without casting the spell again.

NOTE: This spell has no effect on mindless targets, such as robots or plants.

Devours all light from the area, turning the place into darkness.

Upon casting Darkness, all light sources within the spell's radius are quenched. Any natural light disappears and the area becomes pitch black. To the outside the area looks very dark, like a strong shadow, and figures and other features are still visible, meaning that characters outside of the area of effect are not affected by the visibility penalty. To those inside the area the place becomes totally dark and they can barely see anything, resulting in the Visibility -40 penalty to hitting any targets, including adjacent ones.

In addition, upon casting the spell all creatures inside its Area of Effect lose 1 HP. DT, neither from armor or natural doesn't protect from this HP loss.

This spell has 30\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster.

Cause discord and friction between targets.

The spell changes each target's mood and attitude towards negative. Loving becomes indifferent, indifferent become quarrelsome, and quarrelsome become hostile.

Targets may make a CHA or INT (whichever is better) opposed roll with a penalty of -2 to resist the spell. If the spell is successful, the targets react to each other more negatively. Also, targets have 20\% chance to gain 1 Insanity. 

This spell can be used to lower NPC Disposition by 1 per casting. It can also be made to influence targets' mood towards a particular individual more negative. The maximum amount of targets influenced depends on the caster's CHA.

The attack with the blades is considered a Full-Auto attack with a value of 10F, and requires a successful Thaumaturgy roll to hit the target. Each hail of blades deals Potency+(3) in damage.

Boosts the SPECIAL stats of the target

The target of the spell has her physical or mental capabilities boosted for a period of time.

The caster chooses one SPECIAL stat to boost, excluding LCK. Said stat gains a bonus of 2 for Potency minutes. A target may benefit from one SPECIAL bonus from Enhancement at a time.

Outside of combat, this spell can be used to heal SPECIAL damage, with caster's Potency determining the maximum amount of healed SPECIAL penalties. Permanently healing a target adds +4 to AP cost and +3 to Strain cost. Multiple SPECIALs can be healed simultaneously, such as healing 1 point of STR damage, and 2 points of AGI damage. Critical success on the spell's Thaumaturgy roll allows 1 additional point of SPECIAL damage to be healed.

\begin{quote}

Dispels magical effects.

All magical effects in the targeted area are temporarily suppressed on a successful Thaumaturgy roll for 5 rounds. If a magical effect is inherently permanent (such as pegasus flight and cloud interacting), the suppression only lasts for 2 rounds.

The spell can be used to counter other casters. In such cases, the caster makes an opposed roll against affected creatures' END, CHA or INT, whichever is the highest stat. If there are several casters, opposed rolls are made individually against each affected caster. If the roll is successful, the affected creatures are unable to cast spells for 2 rounds. Otherwise it has no effect on the affected casters.

Fear is a nasty spell of the mind; it shows the target their deepest fears, leaving the target in a trance to watch their worst nightmare unfold, after which they come back from the brink a little worse for wear.	

Fear is a potent mind-affecting spell that attacks to the weakest spot of the most: their worst fears. Only the target can see the dark illusion. The spell automatically detects target's fears and works according to them. Target is allowed to make an opposed roll with her INT against the caster's END or take 1 Insanity to resist the spell.

If the target fails, the caster rolls a 1d100, adds her Potency to the roll and refers to the table below:

Result:
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
		\item [1-40]		Moderate Distraction
		\item [41-60]		Inflict 1 Insanity
		\item [61-80]		Inflict Panicked- status effect, might cause physical alterations such as fright-whitened mane
		\item [81-100]		Inflict Stunned- status effect
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

The spell's effects on the target can be removed through regular means of removing said effects.
This spell has 40\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster.

A wasteland critter comes to the caster's aid

The caster has a bond with the surrounding wilds, able to call help from it by concentrating. However, the caster cannot directly determine what kind of critter will come to her aid.

Upon casting the spell, the GM allows one monster from the Monster Manual or his own creation to join the caster's side, which then follows simple commands of the caster for the duration of the spell. If the creature is still present after the effect of the spell ends, it resumes its normal routines - it may walk off or turn hostile, for instance. This spell can summon sentient creatures, by compelling them to help you, even if they normally would not. 

If the caster has the \textit{Fluttershy's Apostle -perk}, the non-sentient creatures that appear with the use of this spell will not turn hostile unless injured. Likewise, non-sentients summoned with this spell do not adhere to the restrictions of the beforementioned perk.

Note: Robots and plants do not heed the call of the caster.

Forces the target's heart to stop.

The target of the spell suffers a heart attack - effectively stopping their heart on the spot.

If the casting of the spell is successful, the target rolls for END. If successful, the target recovers but suffers Moderate Distraction penalties for 3 rounds.

If a failure, the target falls unconscious and is considered dying, perishing within END rounds unless successfully treated with a Hard Medicine-skill check or Medicine- magic school. If a character is successfully healed, they will have as much HP tokens as they had prior to the Heart Attack spell. However, the character will have Minor Distraction penalty for 3 rounds.

Hide the glow of your horn when casting spells.

Caster may concentrate to actively hide the glow of her horn or the aura around targets while casting spells. In effect, caster adds 2 AP and 2 Strain to any spell she uses to cast the spell with her horn's glow hidden. The spell lasts for Potency amount of minutes after which the glow of the caster's horn returns.

Take the life force of another for yourself.

The magic aura of the caster envelopes the target briefly, leeching the life force from the latter to the former.

The caster deals damage to the target equal to 10 + Potency and regains HP equal to HP loss inflicted. The spell ignores all DT of the target, and excess HP healed is not stored. If the target would go to or below 0 HP due the spell, they fall unconscious at 1 HP for 5 rounds and cannot be the target of Life Surge until fully healed.

A tinted light emanates from the caster's horn, matching caster's magic. The light is powerful enough to illuminate the room, but also makes the caster an easy target in the dark.

This spell is known by all unicorns, with the exception of One Trick Pony -trait, and does not take a spot on their known spells list.
 
The caster's horn becomes a dazzling beacon of light, brightly illuminating an area equal to Small Burst Template around the caster. The area within is well-lit, not hampering one's visibility, and beyond that up to Huge Burst Template the light condition becomes dim light. Once activated, the spell lasts for up to an hour, but is dispelled if the caster becomes unconscious.

Makes a mirror to reflect a vision from a predetermined place the caster has been to.

The caster conjures a little mirror on the spot she's standing, and by using the conjured mirror, she can see into places she has visited before. However, to be able to gaze upon the location, the place must have a reflective surface in it; specific size not required.

Once a mirror has been conjured, it will be tangible and can be carried in inventory. The mirror disappears after Potency hours or when a new mirror is conjured. Only the caster can use the mirror with the intended purpose, to others it looks and acts like a regular mirror. \textit{Detection-spell} reveals the true nature of the mirror as a magically created item.

\textbf{Note:} Failsafe cast near the reflective surface the caster is using to look into the area will crack the mirror and force the spell to end.

Clears the caster's mind, providing a one-time bonus for the next spell cast.

The caster puts aside any distraction, putting all his concentration on the next spell she will cast.

By using all available AP the caster has at the start of the round, she can choose to do one of the following with the next spell:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The caster's Potency is increased by 5.
  \item The spell's Area of Effect is one category larger, to a maximum of Huge Burst area.
  \item Opposed Rolls gain +10 to benefit caster.
  \item The next spell has additional effects, approved by GM.
\end{itemize}

However, if the caster receives any damage from outward sources, be it mundane or magical, she must succeed a Thaumaturgy check to maintain concentration. On a failure, the trance breaks and any bonus chosen is lost, and the caster's head has a 20\% chance of being Crippled from the magical backlash.

Allows the caster to implant, copy or remove memories of another.

This spells allows the caster to extract a memory from the target. The target must be willing or restrained, and the caster must touch the forehead of the target the entire duration of the spell. The spell costs 10 AP and 5 Strain. During the spell, both the target and the caster will be incapable of perceiving their surroundings.

Finding the correct memory requires a successful PER roll, and the target may resist the spell with an opposed roll using her CHA or INT. The extracted memory contains all sensations the target had experienced. However, the memory can be warped by chems or psychological states during the occurence of the memory, and does not contain emotions, thoughts or nostalgia. In addition, loss of detail is possible due passage of time. Critical success may help the caster to see the memory in a more pristine form.

The caster can choose to either make a copy of the memory or to erase it completely. If there isn't an appropriate vessel, such as an empty memory orb, the memory automatically becomes the caster's own upon copying. She may choose to make the memory her own even if there was a suitable receptacle.

The spell can also be used to cause the target to experience a memory that can be one of caster's, target's or obtained through Memory Manipulation spell. The triggered memory is very real to the target, affecting all senses. Reliving a memory takes the same amount of time as the actual event. After reliving a memory, it becomes a part of target's own memories.

The caster may decide to force the target to believe the experienced memory is one of her own. The target may attempt to recognize the memory being someone else's, making an opposed roll using her PER or INT. If the roll is successful, the target realizes that it's not her own memory, but still relives it and remembers it later. If the roll fails, the target believes that the memory is her own.

\textbf{Note:} Reliving a memory may grant a bonus of 15 to a skill roll made by the target if the attempted roll is related to a memory, i.e. choosing a correct door code after seeing a memory of someone else using the same locked door. This roll must be made within 2 hours after viewing the memory. The GM decides whether a skill receives a bonus or not.

\textbf{Note:} The target cannot learn new spells this way.

\textbf{Note:} Reliving many memories this way in a short period of time, or reliving the same memory many times, may cause negative mental effects. These include the loss of identity and schizophrenia. The GM and player in control of the character should decide together when the line between safe and unsafe memory reliving is crossed.

Create an illusion that affects senses.

This spell creates an illusion that affects one sense: sight, sound, taste and smell (combined), or touch. The base spell costs 4 AP and 1 Strain. The caster may combine several Mirage spells, creating a more complex illusion affecting several senses. The cost of a complex illusion is the sum of base spells used to create it.

The illusion may be static, costing 0 AP each round, or the caster may manipulate it at will, costing 2 AP every round a manipulation is executed. The spell affects anyone who can observe it, but the caster is immune to it. Affected creatures are allowed to make an opposed roll using their CHA or INT (whichever is better) against the caster's CHA to recognize their sensations are false.

\textbf{Note:} Mirage can alter the properties of the target, which others can observe. For example, a book changes color from red to yellow. The book is the target, but all observers are affected. If the target moves/is moved out of spell's range, the effect immediately ends.

\textbf{Note:} Mirage never actually hampers movement, and is merely a sensory effect.

\textbf{Note:} Mirage normally doesn't move on it own. If created on a relatively large moving vehicle (such as a train or a ship), it moves with the vehicle. If it affects a moving creature, vehicle or object, it moves if the target moves. GM decides on these situations whether the illusion moves or not.

Protects against mental probing and mind-affecting effects.

This spell creates a mental barrier that protects the target against mental probing and mind affecting effects. If the target ends up under hostile mind attack (such as illusions or mind probe), the attacker must roll twice and take the worse result. If the target would be mentally affected (such as get addiction for chems), she may roll twice and take the better result. 

If the character under the effect of this Spell is about to get an Insanity point, they can roll twice to resist. However, they have to take the second roll.

The spell does not have effect on effects that are active upon casting the spell, but if the target's mind is being actively probed, the scanner must roll again.

Gazes into the thoughts and feelings of the target, possibly learning new information.

The caster looks briefly into the target's mind, gathering information he looks for.

Before casting, the caster determines what kind of information she's looking for from the target of the spell. If not specified, the results of Mind Probe are determined by the GM.

On casting, the caster makes an opposed roll of PER against the target's INT or CHA. On a success she has infiltrated the target's mind, gaining access to what she may be looking for. On a failure the caster suffers Minor Distraction due the pushback and following headache for 1 turn, as well as making the target wary of her surroundings, and aware that someone or something was trying to gain access into their head.

In addition to being turned to stone, the target gains Potency DT against damage from firearms, MEWs, Unarmed or bladed Melee weapons. However, from explosives and blunt Melee weapons he will have no extra DT, instead suffering extra damage equal to 10+Potency.

The target starts to hallucinate either auditory or visual imagery, causing confusion on the target.

Each time the target attempts to hit a character with a weapon, they must roll LCK to see if they hit the actual target. The duration of this spell depends on the caster's Potency as follows:
\begin{quote}
  \begin{description}
    \item[$<$10 Potency] 	1 turn
    \item[11-20 Potency] 	2 turns

\medskip

Targeted object becomes phased between two dimensions, making it intangible.

Phase will make the targeted object phase out of the current dimension, making it intangible. If the object is up to Potency*10 centimeters in its largest dimension or smaller, the entire item is phased out. Otherwise the phasing is partial. Outside of combat the duration is 2 minutes, and in combat it is 3 rounds.

Affected object cannot be picked up by creatures, and held items will fall down. If the object is worn on the moment of casting the spell, it is worn while phased. It loses any normal DT, but retains other qualities.

For Phase to work on an object, the caster has to be able to see or touch the item she is attempting to make intangible. Casting Phase on complex items such as safe doors and robots suffer a penalty of -20 to the Thaumaturgy check.

\textbf{Note:} Being as complex as they are, living creatures cannot be a target of Phase. Their worn items, however, can be.

\textbf{Note:} If the affected object is inside another object or creature when the spell ends, and is unable to normally exist there, it is ejected out and loses 2 HP tokens. If the object is inside another object or creature, and would be able to exist there, it remains there and takes no damage.

Magically revert an object to its original condition.

The spell requires that at least 50\% of the targeted object is still there in order to function. In order to repair an item, the caster must succeed on a Mechanics skill roll (or some other appropriate skill roll), and she gains a bonus to her roll equal to her Potency*2. Success immediately repairs all damage done to the object and reverts it to its original, good condition. Missing pieces will reappear, broken parts will mend themselves, and worn materials become whole.

The mending happens instantaneously and the effect is ''permanent'', but future damage and wear affect the item normally.

The base cost of the spell is 4 AP and 1 Strain. However, the condition of the object adds to the cost of the spell as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Relatively new but broken: no additional cost.
  \item A lot of wear and a few bullet holes: 2 AP and 1 Strain.
  \item Severely battle damaged: 5 AP and 2 Strain.
  \item Rusted into a solid, barely recognizable chunk: 10 AP and 4 Strain.

Caster becomes a cloud of dark fog, able to slip through small cracks or enlarge self to intimidate. Caster's facial features are detailed in the fog. 	

Spell transforms the caster into a dark cloud of smoke. While the spell is active, she is able to slip through small cracks and crevasses, or enlarge herself to fill the entire room to intimidate creatures. The spell costs 5 AP and 3 Strain, and can be cancelled at will.

While in Shadow Form, the caster moves double her normal speed. She is immune to physical damage, but MEWs and AoE effects deal damage normally. She herself is unable to use any items while in this form, but she may cast spells. If intimidating or frightening a foe while in this form, she adds her Potency to the roll.

Taking the form is physically and mentally taxing on the caster, which some would equal to milder forms of torture. Upon casting and every minute thereafter, the caster has a 50\% chance to gain 1 Insanity.

Forms a tangible object from your magic for a limited time.

The caster creates a semitransparent object from her own magic, which she can then utilize as she needs. Summoning this object costs 3 AP and 1 Strain.

The caster can have up to 4 different mundane objects simultaneously conjured by Shape Magic. Because of their arcane nature, the objects do not create sounds when hitting normal objects.

\textbf{Note:} Objects created by Shape Magic are considered Improvised Weapons if used in combat. Damage and AP cost depends on the size of the conjured object. These improvised weapons use either melee or unarmed.

\medskip

Creates a magic moldable shield of magical energy that protects against bullets and similar projectile attacks and Magic Energy Weapons. The shield is thin, transparent and matches the color of caster's magic.
 
Shield can be wrapped around any target area within Potency*2 meters of the caster, covering maximum of 6 meters in its largest dimension. The caster chooses upon casting the spell whether the shield's position is fixed (doesn't move) or in relation to the caster (for example, always in front of the caster). Creatures and objects can go through Shield, but damaging projectiles interfere with it.

Shield has a DT determined by caster's Potency, and 5 HP tokens. The DT from Shield stacks with worn equipment, the exact amount determined by Potency as follows:
\begin{quote}
	\begin{description}
  		\item[$<$10 Potency] 	5 DT
  		\item[11-20 Potency] 	10 DT
  		\item[21+ Potency] 		15 DT
	\end{description}
\end{quote}

Attacks that deal more damage than the combined DT value damage the shield first. When the Shield's HP is reduced to 0, the spell ends, and the excess HP loss is dealt normally. The spell works both ways; attacks made from both sides of Shield are affected. Caster can manifest only one Shield at a time, but she can use other spells while Shield is active.

\textbf{Note:} Grenades and similar slow-moving thrown objects pass through Shield. The explosion from grenades, however, does not pass.

\textbf{Note:} When Shield is hit by Arcane Blast, the projectile ricochets in a random direction.

Create a powerful, lifelike illusion of almost anything.

This spell creates nearly perfect illusion that is almost indistinguishable by non-spellcasters. Affected creatures are allowed to make an opposed roll using their PER, CHA or INT (whichever is better) with a penalty equal to caster's Potency against the caster's CHA to recognize their sensations as illusion. It has all the source's properties and acts almost exactly like to original. The cost of the spell depends on what is duplicated. 

If Simulacrum duplicates an object or something quite simple, it costs 5 AP and 2 Strain. This could be a door, a rock, clothing, a painting or a plateful of food. If it duplicates a more complex object or a simple creature, it costs 8 AP and 4 Strain. This could be a weapon that attacks on its own, a critter or a vehicle. If it duplicates a high-end intelligent living creature, it costs 10 AP and 6 Strain. This could be a pony, a monster or a large imaginative weapon or vehicle. The exact illusions made by the spell are up to the caster, and the GM may provide other rules to the use of this spell.

The caster can refresh her illusion by recasting this spell. Refreshing does not cost Strain, but requires AP as previously used as well as a Thaumaturgy roll. This renews the duration of the spell. Once the spell ends, no new Simulacrum can be casted for a minute (10 rounds).

Illusions made by the spell can be used to deal damage. The illusion may attack on its own once per turn at no AP cost for the caster. The damage is equal to caster's Potency*4, bypasses DT, and affects all desired targets within the spell's area, a Large burst centered on the caster. However, this damage is not real and is never lethal; if this spell lowers someone's HP to 0, the target falls unconscious and isn't dying.

\textbf{Note:} Illusion can alter the properties of the target, which others can observe. For example, a book changes color from red to yellow. The book is the target, but all observers are affected. If the target moves/is moved out of spell's range, the effect immediately ends for that target.

This spell subtly blends the illusionary and behavior-affecting aspects of magic, causing the caster to appear in the best possible light.
 
The caster's appealing and positive traits seem more pronounced, while character's less pleasant qualities seem to be more trivial. The spell adds a bonus of 5 + Potency to Barter and Diplomacy checks, and improves NPC disposition by one step. Spell costs 3 AP and 3 Strain.

Common version of the spell affects only the caster. One may instead affect up to 4 other creatures, which then all benefit from the spell. However, this increases the spell's AP and Strain costs by 2 and 2 respectively.

The act of placing a piece of one's soul into an object to obtain immortality -in a sense- rendering the object in question to be nearly impervious to damage. However, the process is beyond painful and could render a person mad.

The caster chooses an object into which she transfers her, or another being's mind and soul. Casting Soul Jar is a long, 8 hour process that requires immense concentration and must be done uninterrupted. As such, it cannot be casted during combat. Soul Jar has no AP cost, but it costs 3 Strain per hour, or 24 Strain in total. If the caster is in any way interrupted during casting, the spell fails. 

This spell's costs can be divided by assisting casters that have this spell, but the brunt of the Strain cost is always on the initial caster. Likewise, the effect of this spell doesn't apply to the assisting casters.

If the spell succeeds, caster's soul fragments and part of the soul inhabits the item in question, thus acting as a vessel for the caster to ''live'' in after her body perishes.

The caster has no control over the item before or after her perishing, but they can express themselves if the item in question is capable of producing sound, image or text. A book used as a soul jar might have text appearing into it from thin air, and a megaphone might start talking by itself. Though they cannot move by themselves, they can still cast spells, though with a -30 penalty to Thaumaturgy if they cannot produce a sound with which to verbally cast a spell.

The caster becomes basically immortal, although destroying the container of her soul with powerful magic will immediately kill her. If the destroyer's Potency is greater than the caster's Potency (who originally cast Soul Jar), the soul container is destroyed and the soul goes with it. If the Potencies of the destroyer and the original caster are equal, there is a 50\% chance of the container being destroyed.

The caster can at a later date transfer her soul into a receptive and willing body. This requires casting Soul Jar again, targeting the new host.

This spell has 100\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster. Assisting casters have a 50\% chance being inflicted with 1 Insanity.

See the general attitude between two or more ponies.

The spell manifests as thin lines between the targets, each color coded to show the social relationship between them. Among the most usual are hatred, envy, neutrality, friendship and love. Only the caster can see the formed lines, though \textit{Detection-spell} will make people aware that a spell is being used on the targets.

However, to gain this information between two targets they have to stand within the range of the spell from each other. On top of that, the caster must be able to see the line in question to decipher the connection.

Forces an object to stay on its original position on the time of the casting.

Any object or creature affected by the spell stays on the position it was at at the time of casting and cannot be moved - not by brute force or telekinesis. 

The target's bodily functions work as normal, allowing them to breathe and perceive their surroundings as much as they're able to without being able to move their heads. The objects can be moved once more when the spell ends, the caster ends the spell, or when Failsafe is successfully cast.

The target under the effects of this spell can attempt to break out of the spell once per round, with a -2 STR or -2 END roll. Breaking out of the spell does not spend AP or Strain.

Allows the target to interact with intangible substances, such as clouds and water, as if they were solid.

Steady Walk allows the target of the spell not only to walk on clouds and other non-tangible surfaces such as water and smoke, but to touch and interact with them as well. It lets the target use cloud technology, even if she's not a pegasus or a griffin. The spell costs 4 AP and 1 Strain.

Summons a small storm cloud that ravages the area.

A small yet volatile storm cloud forms on the point the spell is casted at, having a mind of its own afterwards.

The cloud travels 10 meters (5 hexes) towards the nearest creature, ally or foe, and then discharges lightning bolts on all targets on a Tiny Burst template. The damage is equal to Potency+(3).

\medskip

The easiest and most basic spell, Telekinesis is usually the first spell learned by a unicorn. She envelopes a target with a colorful grasp, and can then physically move or manipulate the target.

This spell is known by all unicorns, with the exception of One Trick Pony -trait, and does not take a spot on their known spells list.

This spell allows a caster to move up to 4 objects, or perform fine manipulation on up to 2 objects. The caster can use any fitting skill or SPECIAL check with the affected objects (such as picking a lock or firing a weapon).

Caster must concentrate on the spell each round she maintains Telekinesis, and taking damage or getting Distracted requires a successful Thaumaturgy roll to keep the spell functional. Upon a failed roll, the spell ends.
In combat, the AP cost for casting Telekinesis, and maintaining the spell depends on the size of the object or character that the spell is used on, as shown by the table below.
% Table

	\rowcolors{1}{gray!30}{gray!10}

       4								& 10 AP						& 12 AP							\\ \hline
	\end{tabu}
		
}
\medskip

Strain cost also depends on the size of the object or character being targeted with the spell, and gets more taxing on the caster the bigger the target is. Strain is spent every 10 minutes outside of combat, and every round in combat.
% Table

	\rowcolors{1}{gray!30}{gray!10}

Potency does limit how big targets a caster can attempt to levitate with telekinesis.
The weight of an object is irrelevant for the purposes of Telekinesis - while the object is under the effects of this spell, the object is considered weightless.

Telekinesis has a range of Potency*2 meters; however, a PER check is necessary to use Telekinesis to move objects outside of your line of sight. Attempting manipulation of objects outside of your line of sight requires a success in a Very Hard skill check.

Self-levitation, the act of affecting oneself with Telekinesis, is exceptionally hard, costing 1 additional Strain each round to merely lighten oneself, and requiring a SPECIAL check each round to maintain. A self-levitated character has a movement cost of 2 AP for 2 meters/1 hex.

The caster's effective STR for attacks using Telekinesis, such as making a melee attack with a telekinetically wielded weapon, is equal to her Potency/2 (to a maximum of 15). The caster may make any combat trick with Telekinesis, but uses the combat trick's rules - the caster's benefit being she can do these at range.

In the case of Grappling with Telekinesis, the caster doesn't gain Grappled status.

Targets may make a Break Free action to break out of a telekinetic grip.

\textbf{Note:} If the caster uses an object to deal damage with Telekinesis (such as bashing with a large rock), the object is considered an Improvised Weapon. The AP cost and damage are determined by the size of the object. Objects with size -2 or smaller are considered small weapons, size -1 are medium weapons, and size 0 are large weapons. Objects larger than size 0 cannot be used to attack directly or as thrown weapons.

\textbf{Note:} If the caster uses Telekinesis to drop objects in order to deal damage (such as dropping a large boulder), there is no additional AP cost. In effect, the caster stops concentrating and the object falls down. If the caster wants to lift and drop the object again, she must cast Telekinesis again. The damage is determined directly by the size/weight of the object. See the rules for falling objects in Environmental Hazards section.

Share thoughts and senses with others.

The caster and any target she chooses to cast this spell with share a link of thoughts, able to communicate with just their mind.

Unlike Mind Probe, the spell does not give the caster an access to the target(s) memories and knowledge - only current thoughts are transferred between any and all under the effect of the same spell.

Caster vanishes and reappears somewhere else almost instantaneously. She can take her friends with her and travel a great distance in mere seconds, or use the space manipulation technique against her enemies and their items.
 
There are four types of teleporting: self-teleportation, long-distance teleportation, teleporting unwilling targets without self-teleport, and teleport unwilling targets with self-teleport.

AP and Strain for Teleport is shown in the table below:

	\end{tabu}
		
}
\smallskip

The first type of teleporting is fast combat self-teleportation and has a short range. The caster can teleport herself up to Potency*2 meters in any direction. This costs 2 AP (regardless of distance) and 2 Strain per 10 meters (5 hexes). If the destination hex isn't visible, the caster must make a successful PER check with a penalty of 3 or there may be a chance of a mishap (up to the GM).

\medskip

The second type of teleporting is slower and has a much larger range. The caster can teleport herself and up to 4 willing allies up to Potency kilometers and costs 2 Strain per kilometer. Only the allies and their immediate belongings are affected and moved to the new location, and all teleporting targets must be next to the caster. The target destination must be familiar* and on the ground or other solid platform.

\medskip

The third type of teleporting is to not teleport herself, and instead move others. The spell can affect one or more targets or items held by the target, and then teleport them to a new location against their will. In such cases, the maximum number of affected targets is 4. Characters the spell is used upon may resist with an END +2 check. The start and end locations must be within Huge Burst template, centered on the caster.

\medskip

The fourth type of teleporting is to move multiple targets with the caster during combat. This works much like the third type of teleporting above, but the range of the spell is Potency*2 meters.

Potency determines how large objects or characters the caster can teleport at maximum, as shown in a table below:
% Table

*A familiar destination is a place where the caster has visited before, on one or several occasions, and spent a total of at least 48 hours of her time. Areas near any of the caster's Arcane Marks placed on ground or solid platforms are always considered familiar destinations.

Series of random words spoken from a point designated by caster, also volume.

The caster forms a little bubble and throws it to the targeted area, where it will spray out few words - distracting others with a Minor Distraction. If the caster has \textit{One Trick Pony -trait} with this spell selected, they cause Moderate Distraction instead.

The spell affects anyone within Large Burst of the targeted area, provided they are not engaged in combat. If they are engaged in combat, they have an opposed roll PER versus the caster's CHA. If they successfully win the opposed roll, they ignore the effect of this spell.

Shape matter to your liking.

The spell can be casted upon any non-magical, non-aware, simple substance, such as metal, clay or wood. The caster can then reshape it at will for 1 round, after which it becomes solid. The effect is permanent. The cost of the spell is determined by the kind of substance is sculpted and how much.

\medskip

If the substance is naturally soft (such as clay or wood), the base cost of the spell is 3 AP and 1 Strain. If the substance is naturally hard (such as stone or metal), the base cost of the spell is 5 AP and 2 Strain.

If the attempted transformation is minor (such as re-shaping a tree, flattening a stone), there is no additional cost. If the transformation is average (such as creating a simple statue out of stone or turning lumber into a door), the cost increases by 2 AP and 1 Strain. If the transformation is major (such as creating a complex statue out of metal or completely deforming a weapon), the cost increases by 3 AP and 2 Strain.

The spell can be used to re-shape objects made of substances that the spell wouldn't normally be able to affect. In such cases, the caster must succeed on an opposed roll against either the targeted object's END or, if the item is worn, the owners AGI, whichever is better.
	
A caster with Potency of 20 or more can transform another creature, making cosmetic changes that can be pretty minor or quite drastic. The GM determines what kind of substance the creature is; a pony would be considered soft, while a timberwolf would be considered a hard material. GM also determines how drastic the suggested alteration is. If the target is not willing, they can resist the transformation with a successful END+2 check.

The minor version produces minor alterations to the target, such as growing mustache or changing the color of the mane. This version costs an additional 4 AP and 2 Strain.

The average version produces more substantial alterations, such as changing target's facial appearance, body type, minor age-related features or size (within the same category). One can make the target to resemble a particular individual (caster must succeed on a PER roll). This version costs an additional 5 AP and 4 Strain.

The major version causes dramatic alterations, such as changing the target's apparent gender, age and race (within the same animal group). This costs an additional 6 AP and 8 Strain.

\textbf{Note:} With this spell, the mass in the transformed object stays the same. For example if transforming a hole in a wall, parts of it must be wider to accommodate the displaced mass.

\textbf{Note:} Sudden changes of large amounts of mass within living creatures can cause undesired effects. Be wary (or not) when casting the spell on living creatures.

These ominous crystals nullify all magic in the worst of ways, leaving unicorns and Earth ponies magicless and pegasi and griffins grounded and unable to control clouds. It is unknown if the crystals grow larger over time.

The caster causes dark crystals to sprout from another unicorn's horn, or a pegasus'/griffin's wings like strange crystal growths. Attempts to use magic or wings leads to a jolt of pain, as well as there being a constant feeling of something integral missing.

Each time a victim of Vile Crystal attempts to use magic or fly, she must succeed on an END opposed roll against caster's END to gain focus through the pain. If the roll is successful, she can cast a spell or fly on that round. If the roll fails, she is unable to do magic or fly. Despite the result of the roll, she must spend the appropriate AP (and Strain) cost for that action, as well as take Potency points of damage that ignores DT.

The spell can be targeted to a creature or to an area. If targeted on a single creature, it costs 8 AP and 2 Strain. If targeted on an area, it costs 12 AP and 6 Strain. All suitable creatures within the infected area have a 10\% chance of getting affected each round they remain, enter or exit the area.

The spell's effects are permanent unless healed through the use of Clean-spell.

This spell has 60\% chance to inflict 1 Insanity on the caster.

Enchants the target and makes all creatures crave it.

All intelligent creatures (except the caster) who observe the spell's target grow an insatiable craving to possess it. They will resort to any non-lethal means to acquire it and hold onto it. The effect on the initial target is Potency minutes, but affected creatures may make a CHA check with a penalty of 3 to shake off the effect prematurely. The spell costs 10 AP and 2 Strain.

This spell manipulates the target's current feelings of aggression by reminding them of their loved ones and people important to them. This spell has a [Spirit Power]*5 chance to succeed in getting the target to flee the fight and return to whoever they find dear. 

Characters with very evil Karma (+50) are immune to the effects of this spell if they have no one they truly care about. Likewise, this spell can backfire if the target in question instead believes the caster to be too big of a threat, or view them as evil. A character with the spell backfired on them gains a +1 to STR and END for [Spirit Power]/2 turns and will not back down from the fight.

Causing the target to flee still rewards the party with EXP, though they will miss out on items the target was carrying.

By uttering a word of their choice, the caster creates a row of ethereal mines. This row can either start or pass through an area within 4 meters (2 hexes) from the caster, with one mine every 2 meters (1 hex).

Upon being triggered, the enemy may try to spot the mine with a PER -2 roll. Successful roll allows them to try and get away from the immediate blast with an AGI roll.

Each mine has the stats of a frag mine [60+(4)], with Tiny Burst radius.

If the space the spell is used in is too narrow to accommodate all the mines one could put down, the excess mines are discarded. For example, if a corridor is 10 meters (5 hexes) wide, and the shaman can put down 6 mines, only 5 mines appear to fill the corridor in a row.

The caster magically forces a creature to either speak or remain silent for the duration of this spell. The target of this spell can attempt an Opposed -1 CHA or -1 END roll to attempt to resist the spell once per Round in combat and once per minute outside of combat. If the target manages to resist the effect of this spell, they gain an immunity to this spell for an hour.

When used to interrogate, this spell does \textbf{not} compel the target to tell the truth, just that they are magically compelled to speak.
