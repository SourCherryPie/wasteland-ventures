	\chapter{Introduction}
	\noindent
	Within this document is listed the items of any kind within \emph{Fallout Equestria: Wasteland Ventures} rules. Be they valuables or junk, crafting parts of complete items, they can be found within these pages.
	
	Below is a quick list of phrases that frequently appear in the statistics of items, each having a quick description added to them.
	
	\chapter{Weapons}
	\noindent
	Lets be frank, in the Wasteland one doesn't survive long without a trustworthy weapon on their side. True, one can utilize their natural physique to down their opponents, or avoid combat entirely, but a little extra never hurts - one can call it ''insurance''.	
	
	You have a few categories to choose your weapon from, listed in the following order:
	
	\begin{verse}
		\textbf{Firearms} - the conventional method of dispatching an enemy from afar. Engineered simultaneously by Earth ponies, Griffins, and Zebras, a wide range of possibilities exist from small pistols to heavy machine guns.
		
		\textbf{Magical Energy Weapons} - the more advanced weapons engineered by both Unicorns and Zebras, these guns, shortened as MEW, utilize arcane or spiritual energies to draw devastating power onto the field.
		
		\textbf{Explosives} - for things that go boom.
		
		\textbf{Melee} - the more honorable way of handling things, close and personal.
		
		\textbf{Unarmed} - you cannot be stripped of weapons, because you are a weapon.
	\end{verse}
	
	Under each weapon is listed a list of \textbf{Modifications} you can apply to the weapon, and change the characteristics more to your liking. Provided you have the caps, you can potentially prolong the time you use a specific weapon through modifying and upgrading it.
	
	Below is a quick list of phrases that frequently appear in the statistics of weapons, each having a quick description added to them.
